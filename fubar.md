Somethign without merging to main

“This is what Bob & Carol did on Bob’s computer when working on the first feature” 

Here's my contribution.
I like working on a team like this.
I'm definitely NOT getting a merge conflict for this, am I?

Too new to code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯



FUUUBAAARRRRRR!!!! (´• ω •`) 

This coding thing is fun, ins't it?

do you have the time? to listen to me whine? about nothing and everything all at once?
i am one of those, melodramatic fools
nurotic to the bone,
no doubt about it
some times i give my self the creeps,
some times my mind plays tricks on me,
it all keeps adding up,
i think im cracking up,
am i just paranoid
or am i just stoned git pgit
